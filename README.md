## Aim: To protect Chandravahan from Debris collision

### Physical Precautions: Use Whipple shield on Chandravahan to reduce damage from Debris. Material in Whipple shield to be used is Kevlar Aluminium Oxide fiber as it is cost efficient and more effective than Nextel Aluminium Oxide fiber.

### Calculative Precautions: We may use a C++ algorithm to select a pathway with least possible collision of Debris with Chandravahan.

### Tech Stacks: 1. C++ for algorithms 2. HTML, CSS and JavaScript
